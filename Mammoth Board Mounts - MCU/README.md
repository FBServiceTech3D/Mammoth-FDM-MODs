The Mammoth-3D MCU Board Mounts with better cooling and most of all not so loud as small fans!
We find that bequiet! 80mm fan for the Raspberry PI and 2x bequiet! 92mm fans for the 22xx or 5160 TMC Drivers work very well and its hard to know if the Fans are realy on.
The bequiet! Fans are 4 pole PWM Fans, so you can get the RPM of the Fan and display it in your Klipper Fan Menu.

Most of all all the MCU Board Mounts offer easy access to the Drivers. Maybe you dont need it in the begining, but if you have a problem you will love the easy access system to get to the Drivers.
If that day would come, feel free the buy me a coffee :-)
